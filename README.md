ðŸš€ How It Works:-

    The creator has the option to create multiple MCQ type questions.
    Other users can join the room entering the code.
    Once the creator starts the quiz, each question will be displayed one-by-one, each having a timer and points awarded based on how fast one answers.
    At the end of the quiz, you will be able to view a leaderboard. The creator can now restart the quiz (having the option to reset the questions).
    Features can be implemented to archive the room and the leaderboard.
